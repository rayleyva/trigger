Summary
=======

Trigger is a framework and suite of tools for interfacing with network devices and managing security policy.  Written by the AOL Network Security team, it is designed to increase the speed and efficiency of network policy management.

Trigger is written in Python utilizing the freely available Twisted Matrix event-driven networking engine. The libraries can connect to network devices by any available method (e.g. telnet, ssh), communicate with them in their native interface (e.g. Juniper JunoScript, Cisco IOS), and return output.

Utilizing the Twisted framework, Trigger is able to manage any number of jobs in parallel and handle output or errors as they return. With the high number of network devices on the AOL network this application is invaluable to performance and reliability.
