About
=====

Trigger is a Python framework and suite of tools for interfacing with network
devices and managing network configuration and security policy. Trigger was
designed to increase the speed and efficiency of network configuration
management.

Trigger's core device interaction utilizes the freely available `Twisted
<http://twistedmatrix.com/>`_ event-driven networking engine. The libraries can
connect to network devices by any available method (e.g. telnet, SSH),
communicate with them in their native interface (e.g. Juniper JunoScript, Cisco
IOS), and return output. Trigger is able to manage any number of jobs in
parallel and handle output or errors as they return. 

Motivation
----------

Trigger was created to facilitate rapid provisioning and automation of
firewall policy change requests by Network Security. It has since expanded to
cover all network device configuration. 

The complexity of the network was increasing much more quickly than the amount
of time we had to spend on administering it, both because AOL's products and
services were becoming more sophisticated and because we were continually
expanding infrastructure. This pressure created a workload gap that had be
filled with tools that increased productivity.

Pre-Trigger tools worked only for some common cases and required extensive
knowledge of the network, and careful attention during edits and loads.
Sometimes this resulted in a system-impacting errors, and it routine work more
dangerous and unrewarding than it should have been.

With the high number of network devices on the AOL network Trigger has become
invaluable to the performance and reliability of the AOL network infrastructure.

History
-------

Trigger was originally originally written by the AOL Network Security team and
is now maintained by the Network Engineering organization.

Once upon a time Trigger was actually called **SIMIAN**, a really bad acronym
that stood for **System Integrating Management of Individual Access to
Networks**. It has since outgrown its original purpose and can be used for any
network hardware management operations, so we decided to ditch the acronym and
just go with a name that more accurately hints at what it does.

Documentation
=============

Please note that all documentation is written with users of Python 2.6 in mind. It's safe to assume that Trigger will not work properly on Python versions earlier than Python 2.6.

For now, most of our documentation is automatically generated form the source code documentation, which is usually very detailed. As we move along, this will change, especially with regards to some of the more creative ways in which we use Trigger's major functionality.

Getting Help
============

Stuff about getting help with Trigger will go here. The following is ripped directly from Fabric's superb documentation and should be replaced.

If you've scoured the :ref:`prose <usage-docs>` and :ref:`API <api_docs>`
documentation and still can't find an answer to your question, below are
various support resources that should help. We do request that you do at least
skim the documentation before posting tickets or mailing list questions,
however!
